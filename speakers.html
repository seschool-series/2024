                            <strong>Session Title:</strong> Software Supply Chain Security
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Software organizations largely did not anticipate how the software supply chain would become a deliberate attack vector. The software industry has moved from passive adversaries finding and exploiting vulnerabilities 
			    contributed by well-intentioned developers, such as log4j, to a new generation of software supply chain attacks, where attackers also aggressively implant vulnerabilities directly into dependencies (e.g., the protestware of node-ipc).  Adversaries 
				also find their way into builds and deployments, such as occurred with SolarWinds, to deploy rogue software. Once implanted, these vulnerabilities become an efficient attack vector for adversaries to gain leverage at scale by exploiting the 
				software supply chain. Software supply chain attacks have had over a 700% increase year-by-year over the last three years. A US Executive Order on Cybersecurity in May 2021 specifically calls out software supply chain security.  Other 
				countries and the European Union are working on similar legislation.
				<br>
				Plummeting trust in the software supply chain may decelerate digital innovation in every domain. Taking back control and restoring trust in the software supply chains is an “all hands on deck” endeavor – from lawyers to software developers 
				to system operators.   This talk will explore lessons learned, practical steps forward, and the practices needed in the journey toward restoring trust in the software supply chain.  Technical practices include detecting malicious software 
				commits, producing and consuming a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), securing development toolchains, code signing, and producing and consuming provenance data for components.

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: On Making Software More Secure
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: In today’s world, where most companies are producing software to differentiate themselves, the pace of development has never been so important, and waiting to address software security vulnerabilities after 
                            completing development - as traditional pipelines would do - can be costly and introduce unnecessary risks. Static analysis is a powerful technique to detect issues early on the software development lifecycle (SDLC) - and shift security       
                            left - to decrease the costs associated with maintainable security since the technique can examine entire codebases without the need to compile and execute the code, i.e., it can be applied during the development phase. However, the scope 
                            of static analysis tools in security, or Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, is vast and still difficult to understand since there is no structured way to classify, organize and compare these tools on different 
                            characteristics (e.g., techniques, programming languages, weakness spectra, performance, etc.) - which hinders the users’ trust and adoption. Building well-structured, real-world-based, and large datasets for testing those tools properly 
                            and fairly - to build users’ trust - is still challenging because of the lack of precise mining approaches and well-documented information. Better datasets are not only important for testing SAST tools but also for providing a ground 
                            truth to AI models to improve SAST tools with risk analysis, alert prioritization, and better representation of the issues found.

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: Security Testing of Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: RESTful APIs (or REST APIs for short) are becoming the standard technology to access web-oriented resources and to interconnect software systems across the public Internet. They operate on the web using 
                            the HTTP protocol, typically exchanging JSON payloads, and for this reason they are also known as Web APIs. Considering their dominant responsibility as cornerstone integration technology to interconnect different computer systems, 
                            it is crucial to reveal defects and vulnerabilities in their implementation as soon as possible. In fact, the security of the overall integrated system builds on top of the security and reliability of the atomic REST APIs that take 
                            part to the composition.
                            <br> In this talk, I will present a security testing approach to automatically detect and test mass assignment vulnerabilities. Mass assignment is one of the most prominent vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. This vulnerability originates 
                            from a misconfiguration in common web frameworks, such that naming convention and automatic binding can be exploited by an attacker to craft malicious requests writing confidential resources and (massively) overriding data, that should 
                            be read-only and/or confidential.
                            <br> This approach has been implemented and evaluated on a set of case studies written in different programming languages. The evaluation highlights that the approach is quite effective in detecting seeded vulnerabilities, with a 
                            remarkably high accuracy.

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: When software vulns got real: security of cyber-physical systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Cyber-physical systems and their security vulnerabilities are attracting a lot of attention: attacks on connected cars received a lot of media exposure, as did attacks on industrial control systems, airplanes 
                            or medical devices. A lot of this interest is driven by vulnerability research (often in the form of “stunt hacking”). While engaging and attractive, does this research really help to answer the fundamental question of how to embed 
                            security analysis in design? Why are we failing? What are the root causes, with a look at software engineering in embedded systems? Throughout this lecture we will try to answer these questions, with a few hands-on examples.
